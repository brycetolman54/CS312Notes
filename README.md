4. [Project 4: Gene Sequencing](Projects/GeneSequencing)

- For triangle, do DFS and make the leaf the min if it is the smallest path so far
- For course schedule, do the idea you had on a homework to see if all conditionals could be met
    - Put all prereqs into a list and see if any are required by themselves
